# Examining RNA secondary structure at R-loops

In this run I am looking at degree of RNA secondary structure over
R-loop forming regions as we expect lower R-loop signal in these regions
compared to other transcribed regions under the hypothesis that secondary
structure would decrease R-loop formation.
