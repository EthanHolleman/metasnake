# 5-24-21: miRNAs as archetypal high structure regions

I was reading the POINT-seq paper for journal club which developed a method to
map the 5' ends of nascent transcripts and spent a lot of time focusing on
mapping co-translational modifications to RNA, notably miRNAs produced by 
DROSHA. 

miRNAs generally have a hairpin loop precursor which should show up as
peaks of secondary structure (high structure score). 

We also would expect to see low R-loop signal over these regions since 
1, we expected secondary structure to reduce R-loop formation and 2,
co-transcriptional processing by DROSHA would likely prevent R-loop formation
since the nascent RNA is cut.
