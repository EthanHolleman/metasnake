# metasnake

Snakemake pipeline for creating metaplots of intersecting genomic data
specified in `bed` and `bedgraph` files. 

## Requirements 

The pipeline depends on having snakemake and conda available. See the
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
installation documentation foe help with this. All other software dependencies
will be installed when the pipeline is first run as long as the `--use-conda`
flag is added to the `snakemake` call.
