# Testing updates

Got things pretty much working last night. Tested with 
`test/rand_feats_samples.py` script which configured so would generate
random regions and observations only at the first base of each feature taking
strand into account. Expected this to produce metaplots with a large peak
right at the first bin and no where else and that is what program produced.

Also so expected results for Fisher plots. Since all regions in
the observation file where located in the regions file. Differences
in + / - strand are due to low sample size and randomly selecting
which strand a regions will be on.

## Created `runs` dir

This directory should be used to store config, sample and region specifying
files in a sub directory with a meaningful name. That way when want to rerun
can just point snakemake to the files in those directories.

Each subdir should also have a `run.sh` script to run the pipeline for the
specific metaplot and should be able to be invoked from the `metaploter`
directory (use relative paths in config type files with this in mind). 

## Bedtools `map` notes

Watch out when using `map` command if there are no overlaps default value of
`.` is printed when often times (and in this case) we want this value to be 0.
